# Snake Game üêç

A simple Snake Game built in Python using the `turtle` graphics library.  
The snake moves around the screen, eats food to grow longer, and the score increases.  
The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or with its own tail.  

## Features
- Classic Snake mechanics (move, eat, grow, die).
- Scoreboard with live score tracking.
- Randomly spawning food items.
- Collision detection with walls and tail.
- Clean OOP structure (`Snake`, `Food`, `Scoreboard` classes).
